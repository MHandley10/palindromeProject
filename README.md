# Palindrome Project

## Purpose of project

This project was intended to produce two algorithms

They are:

1. An algorithm capable of checking a String to determine if it is palindromic

2. An algorithm capable of checking a String containing a sentence for any palindromes and returning the largest one (if one is found)

## Items to complete

**Testing for IsPalindrome Class**

A series of tests needs to be designed to ensure it functions correctly, such as returning false on single letter words (a) and null Strings

*Deadline = To be completed by 14/03/2022*

**Testing for PalindromeChecker Class**

A series of tests to ensure it recognises words correctly and doesn't include symbols as part of words

*Deadline = To be completed by 14/03/2022*

## Completed Items

**IsPalindrome Class (checking a String for if it's palindromic)** - Completed *08/03/2022*

**PalindromeChecker Class (checking a String sentence for palindromes and returning the longest Palindrome)** - Completed *09/03/2022*
